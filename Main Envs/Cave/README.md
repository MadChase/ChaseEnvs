## Summery:  
Environment that has a cave made out of cubes with water like clouds on the ground.

## How to install:
Main (suggeted):  
Go into the info.dat file and find where is says: ("_environmentName":) and make that say: ("_environmentName": "BTSEnvironment",)  
Go download the script here: https://github.com/MadChase/ChromaPlus-Importer/tree/main  
Follow all the steps in the Github page and download the script from releases  
Put the everything in One folder (env.dat, ExpertPlusStandard.dat, and ChromaPlus-Importer-1.0.0.py) and run the script via VSCode  
Go into Chromapper and save the diff and then you should be good to go.

Alternate:    
This is for people who want to do it without the chorma importer (still needs VSCode).    
Open up the your diff in VSCode and search for the word "customData" using ctrl+f.   
(If missing or having multiple go into Chromapper and click the pickaxe tool in the map menu screen for a diff, then type something into the blank space that pops up. Then go back to VSCode ctrl+f for whatever you typed in and use the "customData" that that was in)    
Copy all text in the "customData" of the env.dat file into the diff's "customData".    
Go int Chromapper and save the diff and then you should be good to go.      
Note - make sure to switch the env to the one listed in the main steps


## How to Use:  
If you plan on using cm for chroma ids i HIGHLY suggest getting the ExtendedLightIDs plugin found here: https://github.com/MoistSac/ChroMapper-ExtendedLightIDs which allows you to see the added light ids using alt+p.   
Center Lights: 5 Lasers coming out at you using light ids: (101, 102, 103, 110, 115) from left to right  
Left and Right Lasers: lasers coming out from the water using light ids (1,7,13,19,25)  
Back Lasers: fill light in the back of the environment
