## Summery:  
Environment that is a flying galaxy in the sky

## How to install:  
Main (suggeted):   
Go into the info.dat file and find where is says: ("_environmentName":) and make that say: ("_environmentName": "GagaEnvironment",)   
Go download the script here: https://github.com/MadChase/ChromaPlus-Importer/tree/main   
Follow all the steps in the Github page and download the script from releases
Put the everything in One folder (env.dat, ExpertPlusStandard.dat, and ChromaPlus-Importer-1.0.0.py) and run the script via VSCode
Go int Chromapper and save the diff and then you should be good to go.

Alternate:
This is for people who want to do it without the chorma importer (still needs VSCode).
Open up the diffyour diff in VSCode and search for the word "customData" using ctrl+f.
(If missing or having multiple go into Chromapper and click the pickaxe tool, then type something into the blank space. then ctrl+f for whatever you typed in and use the "customData" that that was in)
Copy all text in the "customData" of the env.dat file into the diff's "customData" and you should then be good to go with using it in cm.
Note - make sure to switch the env to the one listed in the main steps

## How to Use:  
If you plan on using cm for chroma ids i HIGHLY suggest getting the ExtendedLightIDs plugin found here: https://github.com/MoistSac/ChroMapper-ExtendedLightIDs which allows you to see the added light ids using alt+p.   
Everything is on Left Rotating Laser: the auroraâ€™s use light ids 101-125  
Tracks: all the auroras have the "track": "Aurora" then with now space 1-26 (ex: "Aurora10") so you can use animation tracks to move them if you know how
