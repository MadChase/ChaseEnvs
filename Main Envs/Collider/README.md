How to Use:  
If you plan on using cm for chroma ids i HIGHLY suggest getting the ExtendedLightIDs plugin found here: https://github.com/MoistSac/ChroMapper-ExtendedLightIDs which allows you to see the added light ids using alt+p.   
Things on Back Laser: all the lasers are on here with lightids - 101-154

Things on Left Center Lights: All the fill lights are on here with lightids - 1000-1129   
Tracks: You can mess with them though they should be working as intended. Too many to list so just look in you .dat file if you want to mess with them
