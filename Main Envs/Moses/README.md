## Used in:

## Summery:
Environment that is a parting of the seas and has many reflections and lasers 

## How to install:  
Main (suggeted):    
- Go download the script here: https://github.com/MadChase/ChromaPlus-Importer/tree/main  
- Follow all the steps in the Github page and download the script from releases  
- Put everything in One folder (env.dat, ExpertPlusStandard.dat, and ChromaPlus-Importer-1.0.0.py) and run the script via VSCode  

Alternate:    
This is for people who want to do it without the chorma importer (still needs VSCode).    
- Open up the your diff in VSCode and search for the word "customData" using ctrl+f.
(If missing it go into Chromapper and click the pickaxe tool in the map menu screen for a diff, then type something into the blank space that pops up. Then go back to VSCode ctrl+f for whatever you typed in and use the "customData" that that was in)    
- Copy all text in the "customData" of the env.dat file into the diff's "customData".    
- Go into Chromapper and change the env to the env this envomrnt uses and save the diff and then you should be good to go.      
Note - make sure to switch the env to the one listed in the main steps


## How to Use:
If you plan on using cm for chroma ids i HIGHLY suggest getting the ExtendedLightIDs plugin found here: https://github.com/MoistSac/ChroMapper-ExtendedLightIDs which allows you to see the added light ids using alt+p.    

Note: untested with boost colors/the moon   
- Left and Right Sunbeams: Same a base game.   
- Sun: Same as base game but bigger and has a track   
- Left and Right Lasers: lasers on left and right going from ids 1-9, close to far   
- Water  1: has the closest lines on the floor on both sides using light id 1-2    
- Water 2: Has the 2rd closest lines on the floor on both sides using light id 1-2    
- Water 3: light id 101 has a water splashing effect far in the distance. Also has the 3rd closest lines on the floor on both sides using light id 1-2    
- Water 4: Has the 2 Big lasers on the bottom of the Waterfalls using ids 5-6. Also has the farthest lines on the floor on both sides using light id 1-2    

Tracks: has tracks on the sun so you can move it with "track": "sun"
