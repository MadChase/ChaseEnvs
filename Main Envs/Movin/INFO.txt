Summery:  
Big moving triangle that keeps going forever

How to install:  
Go into the info.dat file and find where is says: ("_environmentName":) and make that say: ("_environmentName": "DragonsEnvironment",)  
Go download the script here: https://github.com/MadChase/ChromaPlus-Importer/tree/main  
Follow all the steps in the Guthub page and download the script from releases  
Put the eveything in One folder (env.dat, ExpertPlusStandard.dat, and ChromaPlus-Importer-1.0.0.py) and run the script via VSCode   
NOTE: This env specific NEEDS Noodle to work (ie, needs both chroma and noodle in the map)   

How to Use:  
If you plan on using cm for chroma ids i HIGHLY suggest getting the ExtendedLightIDs plugin found here: https://github.com/MoistSac/ChroMapper-ExtendedLightIDs which allows you to see the added light ids using alt+p.   
Everything is on Big Rings: all the moving lights are on lightid 101-364. The order of these light ids is wierd so here is what i know, Light ids 346,142-179, and 101-125 are on the bottom and the rest are on the top two.  
Tracks: You can mess with them though they should be working as intended. Too many to list so just look in you .dat file if you want to mess with them
