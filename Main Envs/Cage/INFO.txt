How to Use:  
If you plan on using cm for chroma ids i HIGHLY suggest getting the ExtendedLightIDs plugin found here: https://github.com/MoistSac/ChroMapper-ExtendedLightIDs which allows you to see the added light ids using alt+p.   
Everything is on Big Ring Neons: 
The Big Cube in the middle is LightID:101  
The fill lights from the lane are LightID:1001-1003 plus other fill lights for LightID:150-153  
The lasers around the area are LightID:2001-2010.  
Tracks: You can mess with them though they should be working as intended. Too many to list so just look in you .dat file if you want to mess with them
