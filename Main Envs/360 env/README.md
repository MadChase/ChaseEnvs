## How to install:  
**Main** **(suggeted):**    
Go download the script here: https://github.com/MadChase/ChromaPlus-Importer/tree/main  
Follow all the steps in the Github page and download the script from releases  
Put everything in One folder (env.dat, ExpertPlusStandard.dat, info.dat, and ChromaPlus-Importer-1.0.0.js) and run the script via VSCode   
Go into Chromapper and save the diff and then you should be good to go.

**Alternate:**    
This is for people who want to do it without the chorma importer (still needs VSCode).    
Open up the your diff in VSCode and search for the word "customData" using ctrl+f.   
(If missing or having multiple go into Chromapper and click the pickaxe tool in the map menu screen for a diff, then type something into the blank space that pops up. Then go back to VSCode ctrl+f for whatever you typed in and use the "customData" that that was in)    
Copy all text in the that is not the starting text or featured text (where customEvents or environment start mos t the time) of the env.dat file into the diff's "customData".    
Go into Chromapper and save the diff and then you should be good to go.      
Note - make sure to switch the env to the one listed in the env.dat


## How to Use:  
If you plan on using CM for chroma ids I HIGHLY suggest getting the ExtendedLightIDs plugin found here: https://github.com/MoistSac/ChroMapper-ExtendedLightIDs which allows you to see the added light ids using alt+p.    

Everything is on Left and Right Rotating Laser, each of which using light ids 1-36 making 36 lasers on each side.
